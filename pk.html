        <p>The Punjab Kings, also known as PBKS, formerly known as Kings XI Punjab, are a professional Twenty20 cricket team based in New Chandigarh, Punjab, that competes in the Indian Premier League (IPL). The franchise is jointly owned by Mohit Burman, Ness Wadia, Preity Zinta and Karan Paul. The team plays its home matches at the Maharaja Yadavindra Singh International Cricket Stadium, although since the 2010 season, they have played some matches at Dharamshala and Indore. Apart from the 2014 season when they topped the league table and finished runners-up, the team has only made one other playoff appearance. The team emerged as Runner Ups in 2014 Indian Premier League when they lost the finals against Kolkata Knight Riders and, also in 2025 Indian Premier League when they lost the finals against Royal Challengers Bengaluru.

The franchise played in the now-defunct Champions League Twenty20 once, in 2014 when they finished as semi-finalists. The team name was changed to Punjab Kings in February 2021. In 2025 IPL auction, the franchise made the second highest-ever bid for a player in the IPL, paying â‚¹26.75 crore (US$3.2 million) for Shreyas Iyer.[2]</p>
