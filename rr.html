        <p>The Rajasthan Royals, also known as RR, are a professional Twenty20 cricket team based in Jaipur, Rajasthan, that competes in the Indian Premier League (IPL).[3] Founded in 2008 as one of the initial eight franchises, the team is owned by Manoj Badale and The Royals Sports Group.[4] The Royals team is based at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur.[5][6] It plays its home matches at Sawai Mansingh Stadium and at Assam Cricket Association Stadium, Guwahati.[7]

The team won the inaugural edition of the IPL under the captaincy of Shane Warne, despite being written off as a title contender by the media and fans. The Royals were also the runners-up of the 2013 Champions League Twenty20 under Rahul Dravid's captaincy,[7][8] and the runners-up of the 2022 Indian Premier League under the captaincy of Sanju Samson and leadership of Kumar Sangakkara. The team qualified for playoffs in 2024 Indian Premier League but lost to Sunrisers Hyderabad in qualifier 2 by 36 runs under the captaincy of Sanju Samson and leadership of Sangakkara. The team had announced former team India coach and ex-Rajasthan Royals player and mentor Rahul Dravid as Head Coach for IPL 2025.[9]

On 14 July 2015, the verdict reached by a panel appointed by the Supreme Court of India suspended Rajasthan Royals and Chennai Super Kings for two years over a 2013 betting scandal, meaning they could not participate in both the 2016 and 2017 IPL tournaments. The team returned to the competition with the 2018 season.

The team's record run-scorer is Sanju Samson with 4219 runs,[10] while the leading wicket-taker is Shane Watson, with 67 wickets.[11]</p>
