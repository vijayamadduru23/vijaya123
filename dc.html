        <p>The IPL is a cricket league organised by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and backed by the International Cricket Council (ICC). The inaugural tournament was held in April–June 2008, in which the BCCI finalised a list of eight teams that participated in the tournament. The teams represented eight different cities in India, including Delhi. The teams were put up for auction in Mumbai on 20 February 2008, and the Delhi team was bought by the property development company GMR Group for US$84 million.[3]

In March 2018, GMR sold a 50% stake in the Delhi Daredevils to JSW Sports for ₹550 crore (US$65 million).[4]

JSW Sports is also the owner of Hockey India League team Soorma Hockey Club, Pro Kabaddi League team Haryana Steelers, Indian Super League team Bengaluru FC, SA20 team Pretoria Capitals, and ILT20 team Dubai Capitals.

In December 2018, the team changed its name from the Delhi Daredevils to the Delhi Capitals.[5] Speaking about the rationale behind changing the team's name, co-owner and chairman Parth Jindal said, "Delhi is the power centre of the country, it is the capital, therefore the name Delhi Capitals."[6] Co-owner Kiran Kumar Grandhi said, "The new name symbolizes Delhi's identity and just like the city, we are aiming to be the centre of all action going forward."[7]

Subject to ratification by the England and Wales Cricket Board, in 2024 the franchise agreed a £120 million deal to buy Hampshire County Cricket Club in England, as well as a 51% stake in the Hundred team Southern Brave.[8]</p>
